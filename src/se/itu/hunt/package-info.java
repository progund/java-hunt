/**
 * <p>Contains the classes for this small example game. The game was inspired by a
 * C programming exercise by
 * <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/sv/personal/Sidor/joachim-hacht.aspx">Joachim von Hacht</a>: <br>
 *  Hunt - A simple silly game.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  It was ported to Java by Rikard.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  C programming language version here:
 *  <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2009/course/LEU480/lect/ch5/sillyhunt.c">sillyhunt.c</a>(chalmers.se).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The objective of the game is to move around on a board and try to find a hidden treasure
 * (randomly put at one coordinate of the board).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rikard thought it was fun to write an object-oriented Java version of the game, in particular
 * it was fun to see the original 99 lines of C-code grow into some 900 lines of Java code!
